Building on Windows
-------------------

Run `build_win32_all.cmd` to build executables for all supported targets.

Optionally, run one of the `win32_*.cmd` files in the `_build` directory to build for a specified target.

Built executables will be placed in the `_build` directory.

Also you can run one of `open_*.cmd` scripts to open project
in the corresponding version of Visual Studio.

The build system is currently designed to run on Ubuntu Linux.

Optionally, run one of the `linux_*.sh` files in the `_build` directory to build for a specified target.

Built executables will be placed in the `_build` directory.
